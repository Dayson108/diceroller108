		<p>Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice).</p>
		<p>Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>
		<p>Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object canâ€™t benefit from being invisible.</p>
