		<p>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloack, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.</p>
		<p>This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell canâ€™t restore magic to such an object.</p>
