		<p>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range.</p>
		<p>All creatures and objects that arenâ€™t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.</p>
		<p>If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p>
		<p>At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.</p>
