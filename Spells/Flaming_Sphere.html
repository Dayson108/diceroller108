		<b>At Higher Levels</b><br>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.<hr>
		<p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. </p>
		<p>Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
		<p>As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 Feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphereâ€™s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.</p>
		<p>When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 Feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. </p>
