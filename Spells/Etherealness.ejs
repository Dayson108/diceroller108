Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p><p>When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage.
