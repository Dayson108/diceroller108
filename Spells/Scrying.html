		<p>You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.</p>
		<p><b>Knowledge - Save Modifier</b>Secondhand (you have heard of the target) - +5<br>Firsthand (you have met the target) - +0<br>Familiar (you know the target well) - -5<br><b>Connection - Save Modifier</b><br>Likeness or picture - -2<br>Posession or garment - -4<br>Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like - -10</p>
		<p>On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.</p>
		<p>On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 Feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you w ere there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 Feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.</p>
		<p>Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.</p>
