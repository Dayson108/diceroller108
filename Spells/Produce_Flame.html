		<p>A flickering flame appears in your hand.</p>

		<p>You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 Feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.</p>
