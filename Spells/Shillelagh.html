		<p>The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power.</p>
		<p>For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon</p>
