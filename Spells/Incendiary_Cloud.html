		<p>A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range.</p>
		<p>The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p>
		<p>When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>
		<p>The cloud moves 10 Feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.</p>
