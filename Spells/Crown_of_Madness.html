		<p>One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.</p>
		<p>While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.</p>
		<p>The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.</p>
		<p>On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.</p>
