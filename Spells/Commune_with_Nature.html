		<p>You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory.</p>
		<p>In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesnâ€™t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.</p>
