		<b>At Higher Levels</b><br>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.<hr>
		<p>A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. </p>
		<p>The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.</p>
		<p>A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.</p>
		<p>A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.</p>
		<p>This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell. </p>
