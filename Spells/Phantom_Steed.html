		<p>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creatureâ€™s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 Feet away from the steed.</p>
		<p>For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 Minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.</p>
