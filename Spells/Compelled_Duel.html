		<p>You attempt to compel a creature into a duel.</p>
		<p>One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 Feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn.</p>
		<p>The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 Feet away from the target.</p>
