		<p>You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration.</p>
		<p>Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 Feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 Feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.</p>
		<p> The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.</p>
		<p>Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.</p>
