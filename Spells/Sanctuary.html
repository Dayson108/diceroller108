		<p>You ward a creature within range against attack.</p>
		<p>Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesnâ€™t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.</p>
		<p>If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.</p>
