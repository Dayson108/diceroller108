		<b>At Higher Levels</b><br>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.<hr>
		<p>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damagfe on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
		<p>If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.</p>
		<p>If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.</p>
