		<p>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion.</p>
		<p>Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that wonâ€™t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.</p>
		<p>A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.</p>
		<p>An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</p>
