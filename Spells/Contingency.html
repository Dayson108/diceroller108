		<p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 Action, and that can target you.</p>
		<p>You cast that spell called the contingent spell as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesnâ€™t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p>
		<p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to. and then contingency ends.</p>
		<p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>
