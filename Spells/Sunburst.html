		<p>Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range.</p>
		<p>Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 Minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
		<p>A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.</p>
		<p>This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.</p>
