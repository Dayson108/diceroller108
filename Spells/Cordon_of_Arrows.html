		<b>At Higher Levels</b><br>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each slot level above 2nd.<hr>
		<p>You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition – arrows or crossbow bolts – in the ground within range and lay magic upon them to protect an area. </p>
		<p>Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 Feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains. </p>
		<p>When you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them. </p>
