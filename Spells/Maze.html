		<p>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.</p>
		<p>The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).</p>
		<p>When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
