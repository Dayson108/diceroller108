		<p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range.</p>
		<p>Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a sucessful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.</p>
		<p>The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.</p>
