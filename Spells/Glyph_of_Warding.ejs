If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.<hr><p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-footradius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p><p>When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light.</p><p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p></body></html>
