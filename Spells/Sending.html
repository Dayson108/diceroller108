		<p>You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, regonizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.</p>
		<p>You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesnâ€™t arrive.</p>
