		<p>You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain.</p>
		<p>The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
		<p>A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.</p>
