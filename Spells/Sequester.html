		<p>By means of this spell, a willing creature of an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration.</p>
		<p>When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by the divination of spells.</p>
		<p>If the target is a crreature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.</p>
		<p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include after 1,000 years or when the tarrasque awakes. This spells also ends if the target takes any damage.</p>
