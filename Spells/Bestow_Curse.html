		<p>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:</p>
		<p>•Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.</p>
		<p>•While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</p>
		<p>•While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.</p>
		<p>•While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. A remove curse spell ends this effect.</p>
		<p>• At the DM’s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse’s effect.</p>
