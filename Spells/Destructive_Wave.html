		<p>You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 Feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone.</p>
