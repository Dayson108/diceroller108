Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.<hr><p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range.</p><p>Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.</p><p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p></body></html>
